# 🎄 Data Science Advent Calendar 2025

24 days of **Data Science tips, code snippets, and visual insights** — one per day, from December 1st to 24th.
Each day opens a new mini-tutorial in Python featuring **pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and general data science best practices.

## 🧭 What this is

This project is a learning advent calendar built with html.
Each “day” contains a short, focused tip — a concept explained with code, examples, and references.
It’s designed to be read in small doses: learn something new in under 5 minutes.

Example topics:
- 🐼 Efficient `pandas` tricks
- 📊 Visualization design in `matplotlib` & `seaborn`
- ⚡ Performance tuning & memory management
- 🧠 Practical data science patterns
